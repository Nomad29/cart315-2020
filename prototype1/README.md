# Prototype 1 - Design Journal

**DESIGN QUESTION & MAIN IDEA**

"*Does integrating a luck factor in a game makes the gameplay feel more rewarding for players?*"

This prototype is based on the idea of relying on one's luck to progress, as it creates a game where it takes more than your gaming ability to continue. This concept could be use for an exploration game or even a competitive one in a first person setting. In a new decade where gaming is now considered a sport, I found that integrating a factor of luck could create a gameplay experience that is more even for everybody and more challenging.

**SURVEY FOR PLAYTESTERS**

1. What was the reaction(s) that came to mind by achieving the top by falling, or not, through a platform, knowing it was all luck?
2. Can the prototype be made different by adjusting the luck factor? How?
3. Does falling without being impaired influence your gameplay experience? Could it change the experience if impaired?
4. Would changing the player's view to 3rd person would make it easier to climb by seeing clearly where the player's avatar is?
5. Was the objective of going to the top clear enough? Would you change something?

**PLAYTEST RESULTS**

1. At first, the players that started felt a great satisfaction of success while the others were slowly experiencing frustration and confusion. The confusion was about how the collider was applied to turn off at random â€“ not realising that it was *luck* but instead a problem with the mesh on top of the magenta blocs while completely out.
2. For this second question, the answers were also biaised as one did not find that changes were necessary and on the other hand, was alright. The one that said yes, proposed adding a slippery option to the platforms that could be affected by luck also or add wind that could push against you at random.
3. The same players that experienced frustration quickly responded no, because it could be even more frustrating. Moreover, others who had a better experience said yes, as it could mean a more meaningful victory.
4. For the first time in this survey, all players were on the same side, saying that a third person controller would have been better. They said that it would make positioning easier and the luck factor clearer.
5. One last biaised response was that no, nothing was needed to add to this prototype and the others, yes. The ones that voted positively to changes took longer to understand the objective, often after a moment of looking around. The same people also proposed diverse touches as a simple instruction text at the beginning or a more unique and pronounced climbing wall.
