# Prototype 2 - Design Journal

**DESIGN QUESTION & MAIN IDEA**

"*Does using teleporters in a game makes the gameplay more fulfilling when in this type of setting?*"

This prototype is based on the idea of relying on teleporters, simple puzzles and a following enemy to progress, as it creates a game where players are required to explore to continue. This concept could be use for an exploration/puzzle game in a third person character view. While there is tons of this type of game, I found that integrating teleporters could help create a gameplay experience that is far more complex when use in an universe that has to travel through two dimensions or more.

**SURVEY FOR PLAYTESTERS**

1. What was the reaction(s) that came to your mind by using for the first time a teleporter?
2. Can the prototype be made different by changing how the teleporters are used? How?
3. The teleportation aspect is the main element leading the gathering of objects and the beginning of the chase by the Sphere. Would you change or delete these options to alter the teleportation gameplay and why?
4. Would changing the player with a FPS Controller would make it easier to navigate the existing limited spaces? Explain why.
5. Was the large text at the start and the environment made the objective clear enough? Would you change something?
